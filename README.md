# [NO LONGER FUNCTIONAL] Formerly, script for downloading volumes from the mokuro.moe/manga repository. Currently not functional because the repository is no longer publicly available. 

# Why use this?

Sometimes, there are entire volumes/manga folders already in the <a href="https://mokuro.moe/" target="_blank">mokuro repository</a> that are inaccessible through <a href="https://catalog.mokuro.moe/" target="_blank">the catalog</a> (they don't load). Because I was having that problem with a manga I wanted to immerse with, I created this script to download manga directly from the repository along with the volume's respective .mokuro file, so that I could just drag and drop the folder and the file into <a href="https://reader.mokuro.app/" target="_blank">the reader</a> and read without any complications. If you're having a similar problem, this might be useful to you.

# Pre-requisites
- Python 3.13 or newer

# Usage
If you do not have Python 3.13 or newer, install it through their <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank"> official website</a>. Make sure to check the box for adding Python to PATH during installation.

Once Python is installed, run this in CMD:
```
pip3 install requests bs4
```
This will install the modules that make requests to the website and parse html documents, respectively.

Once that is done, download mokuro_downloader.py from this directory and put it in the folder where you would like your manga to be downloaded to and run it. The actual usage of the script is intuitive.

# Heads-up
The script functions on the assumption that volume folders never have sub-directories. If, for some reason, that is not the case for a certain volume in the repository, the program will not work as expected. I could implement a solution for that, but, as far as I know, all of them have only the image files for the volume. Of course, I could be wrong, so please let me know if I do need to improve the script.

# Final comments

I am a beginner information systems student with no real experience in software development. This was my first project, so there are probably various issues I'm not aware of within the code, so I'd be more than happy to hear what you think about it and what I can do to improve in the future.
